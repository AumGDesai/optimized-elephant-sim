# Optimized Elephant Population Simulation 

This project builds on the previous elephant simulation by introducing **performance and structural optimizations** to simulate elephant population dynamics in **Kruger National Park**.

### 🐘 Enhancements
- More efficient data structures and functions
- Streamlined simulation flow
- Reduced memory usage and better performance on large populations

### ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Performance profiling
- Optimized simulation logic

### 📁 Key Files
- `elephant.py`: Core elephant behavior and population structure
- `optimize.py`: Optimization logic
- `extension.py`: Extended features
- `test_elephantSim.py`: Tests for correctness and performance
- `Lab06`: Related assignment or base implementation
